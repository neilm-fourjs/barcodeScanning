# barcodeScanning
A Genero demo for various methods of barcode scanning.

NOTE: I've only tested this on Linux and makefile is for Linux.

After cloning you'll need to:
* edit the makefile to set the paths correct for your Java and AndroidSDK
* set your Genero environment ( Genero 3.20 is the minimum version )
* run 'make' to git clone the dependancies

The examples:
* Default Genero Mobile
* Webcomponent based on: https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS
* Cordova plugin: https://github.com/leopatras/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner
